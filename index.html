        <p class="lead mb-4">My name is Lily Tran. I am a current 4th year student at UC Riverside. I currently hold a 3.76 cumulative GPA and I have been on the Dean's Honors List 7 times. I will be receiving my Bachelors of the Sciences in Sociology at the end of Spring quarter of 2023. I will be attending UC Los Angeles's MSW program starting Fall of 2023. <br><br>

        I am looking to work with victims of generational trauma and abuse as well as LGBTQ+ identifying individuals. I am also interested in working with adults with disabilities. As a member of the LGBTQ+ community and an Asian-American, I would like to serve a wide range of marginalized communities throughout my lifetime. Once I complete my Masters in Social Welfare, I intend to start working towards getting licensed as a Licensed Clinical Social Worker. With this license, I intend to work as a therapist.<br><br>

         I have experience writing in ASA, MLA, and APA. I also have experience analyzing data and statistics in SPSS and STATA. I have been a volunteer for Active Minds, Mentor Collective, and the Student Disability Resource Center as a peer mentor. I worked at Katella Medical Group as a front desk employee and for The Well as the Student Director of Membership and Metrics. During my time as the Student Director of Membership and Metrics, I trained 42 peer health educators and acted as a peer lead to 8 students. I used Excel to manage and create a budget and inventory sheet. I created Instagram posts for Active Minds and used Notion to keep track of active membership and update quarterly event information. At Katella Medical Group, I worked with adult patients of varying ages and recorded data about patients using Practice Fusion. I verified patient insurance using the Blue Cross and Family Choice websites and requested medical records from pharmaceutical companies like CVS. I am currently acting as the Student Disability Union President and in this role, I currently lead board meetings and collaborate with other group members to secure funding. I also attend events hosted by the Student Disability Resource Center and other affiliated organizations. I acted as a panelist at the Power of the Peers Student Campus Resource Panel in 2022. I received an award for Excellence in Leadership from the Student Disability Resource Center and a Certificate of Achievement from Active Minds in 2022. I also presented at a roundtable at the American Sociological Association Conference in 2022. The paper I wrote was titled "The Effects of French Colonization on Vietnamese Religious Beliefs" and it detailed the history of Catholicism in Vietnam. My completed Senior Thesis was titled "The Effects of Toxic Gamer Culture on the Experiences of Women in the Gaming Industry" and it was written about misogyny and gender discrimination in the gaming and tech industries. I am a certified Peer Health Coach and a NASPA certified Peer Educator. I completed the Kognito training courses titled "At-Risk for College Students" and "Cultivating Inclusive Communities".
